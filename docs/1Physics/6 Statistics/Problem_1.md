# 📊 Problem 1: Exploring the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) Through Simulations

---

## 🎯 Motivation

The **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** is one of the foundational concepts in probability and statistics. It provides a powerful explanation for why the **normal distribution** appears so frequently in real-world phenomena.

**Definition**: The CLT states that the **distribution of sample means** of a sufficiently large number of independent samples, drawn from any population with a finite mean and variance, will approximate a **normal distribution**, regardless of the shape of the original population distribution.

Understanding the CLT is essential because:

- It justifies the use of the normal distribution in hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.
- It supports the validity of many statistical methods and machine learning algorithms.
- It offers practical guidance for data analysis, especially in sampling and estimation.

This project brings the CLT to life using simulations across different population types. You’ll see how sample size and distribution shape influence the convergence of the sampling distribution to normality.

## 1️⃣ Simulating Sampling Distributions

We examine the CLT by sampling from three distinct types of **population distributions**:

- 📦 **Uniform Distribution**: All values within a range are equally likely.
- 🔁 **Exponential Distribution**: A skewed distribution with a high frequency of smaller values.
- 🎯 **Binomial Distribution**: A discrete distribution based on the number of successes in a fixed number of trials.

### 🔧 Population Generator Code

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Generate population samples of different distribution types
def generate_population(distribution, size=100000):
    if distribution == 'uniform':
        return np.random.uniform(0, 1, size)
    elif distribution == 'exponential':
        return np.random.exponential(1.0, size)
    elif distribution == 'binomial':
        return np.random.binomial(n=10, p=0.5, size=size)
    else:
        raise ValueError("Unsupported distribution")
```

This function generates a large sample of 100,000 values from each of the specified distributions, which we will use as our population to sample from.

## 2️⃣ Sampling and Visualization

We draw many samples from the population and compute the mean of each sample. Then, we observe how the **distribution of these sample means** changes with the **sample size**.

### 🧪 Sample Means Function

```python
def sample_means(population, sample_size, num_samples):
    return [np.mean(np.random.choice(population, size=sample_size, replace=True)) for _ in range(num_samples)]
```

### 📊 Plotting Function

```python
def plot_sampling_distribution(population_type, sample_sizes, num_samples=1000):
    population = generate_population(population_type)
    fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, len(sample_sizes), figsize=(5 * len(sample_sizes), 4))
    for i, size in enumerate(sample_sizes):
        means = sample_means(population, size, num_samples)
        sns.histplot(means, kde=True, ax=axes[i], bins=30, color='skyblue')
        axes[i].set_title(f"{population_type.capitalize()} Dist\nSample Size = {size}")
        axes[i].set_xlabel("Sample Mean")
        axes[i].set_ylabel("Frequency")
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()

# Example usage:
plot_sampling_distribution("exponential", [5, 10, 30, 50])
```

This produces multiple histograms, each showing how the distribution of sample means evolves as the sample size increases.

## 3️⃣ Parameter Exploration and Observations

### 🔍 Key Observations

- As the **sample size increases**, the **spread of the sampling distribution decreases**, and the distribution becomes **more symmetric and bell-shaped**.
- For **symmetric populations** like the uniform distribution, normality is achieved quickly.
- **Skewed distributions**, such as the exponential distribution, require **larger sample sizes** to observe the CLT in action.

### 📏 Variance Shrinkage

The **standard deviation** of the sampling distribution (also called the **standard error**) decreases as the sample size increases:

$\text{Standard Error} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$

Where:

- $\sigma$ = population standard deviation
- $n$ = sample size

This explains why the sampling distribution gets narrower with larger samples.

## 4️⃣ Practical Applications

### 💼 Real-World Use Cases of CLT

- **📦 Manufacturing & Quality Control**: Use the average of sampled measurements to detect defects.
- **🗳️ Political Polling**: Estimate population preferences with a margin of error.
- **📈 Finance & Economics**: Predict average returns or growth rates.
- **🧪 Medical Research**: Use sample averages to estimate treatment effects.
- **📊 Business Analytics**: Make decisions based on customer sample behavior.

## 💡 Hints for Deeper Exploration

- Try adding **Poisson** and **Gamma** distributions for more variety.
- Use **standardized sample means**: subtract the mean and divide by the standard error.
- Explore **convergence rate** numerically: compute skewness and kurtosis at different sample sizes.
- Overlay a **normal distribution curve** to visually confirm convergence.
- Compare results to the **Law of Large Numbers**, which ensures the sample mean approaches the population mean.
